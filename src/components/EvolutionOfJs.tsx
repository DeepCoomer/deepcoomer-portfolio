              JavaScript is a programming language that is present everywhere,
              that powers the web, it has come a long way since its inception in
              the mid 90s. It started out as a scripting language designed to
              enhance web pages, but now at present JavaScript has evolved into
              a powerful and versatile language used for both front-end and
              back-end development. In this blog post, I'll take you to a
              journey through the key milestones in the evolution of JavaScript.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h4 className="content-header">1995: Birth of JavaScript</h4>
            <p>
              In 1995, Brendan Eich at Netscape Communications Corporation
              created JavaScript. It was originally called "Mocha" and later
              "LiveScript," it was eventually named "JavaScript" to leverage the
              rising popularity of Java. As Shakespeare says "What's in a
              name?", likewise JavaScript has nothing to do with Java. Designed
              in just 10 days, JavaScript was initialy aimed to add
              interactivity to web pages.

            <h4 className="content-header">
              1996-1999: ECMAScript Standardization
            </h4>
            <p>
              ECMAScript (ES) is the standardized version of JavaScript.
              ECMAScript 1 was released in 1997, followed by versions 2 and 3.
              These standards laid the foundation for modern JavaScript which is
              being used today by introducing essential language features.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h4 className="content-header">2000s: Ajax and Web 2.0</h4>
            <p>
              The 2000s witnessed the emergence of Asynchronous JavaScript and
              XML (Ajax), a technique that allowed dynamic and interactive web
              applications without requiring full page reloads. This era also
              saw the rise of libraries like Prototype, Script.aculo.us, and
              jQuery, which simplified DOM manipulation and asynchronous request
              handling. It also witnessed the birth of Node.js, an open-source,
              cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment and library for
              running web applications outside the client browser. It is used
              for server side development.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h4 className="content-header">2009: ECMAScript 5 (ES5)</h4>
            <p>
              ES5, introduced in 2009, brought significant improvements. It
              included support for JSON, introduced strict mode for better code
              quality, and enhanced Array and Object manipulation methods.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h4 className="content-header">
              2010s: Rise of JavaScript Frameworks
            </h4>
            <p>
              The 2010s marked a turning point with the rise of JavaScript
              frameworks. Backbone.js, AngularJS, Ember.js, and React emerged,
              enabling developers to build structured and maintainable web
              applications. Combining the abilities of these frameworks with the
              ability of Node.js, fueled the growth of full-stack JavaScript
              development.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h4 className="content-header">2015: ECMAScript 6 (ES6)</h4>
            <p>
              ES6, released in 2015, was a milestone update. It introduced
              modern features such as arrow functions, classes, promises,
              modules etc.
            </p>

            <br />
            <h4 className="content-header">
              2016-2021: Rapid Evolution of ECMAScript
            </h4>
            <p>
              Subsequent ECMAScript versions (ES2016, ES2017, ES2018, ES2019,
              ES2020, ES2021, ES2022, ES2023) continued to introduce new features. Async/await,
              spread/rest operators, optional chaining, nullish coalescing,
              BigInt, and private class fields are just a few examples.
              TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript with optional static typing,
              gained popularity for larger projects.
            </p>

            <br />
            <h4 className="content-header">Modern JavaScript</h4>
            <p>
              Today, JavaScript's ecosystem continues to evolve with a primary
              focus on developer productivity, performance, and new language
              features. JavaScript is now not just limited to web development, It is
              used for server-side development with Node.js, mobile app
              development with React Native, and even desktop applications using
              Electron.
            </p>

            <br />
            <p>
              In conclusion, the journey of JavaScript from a simple scripting
              language to a versatile and powerful tool has been remarkable.
